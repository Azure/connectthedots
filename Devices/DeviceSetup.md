# Device setup  #
The basic premise of this project is that data from sensing devices can be sent upstream in a prescribed JSON format. This might be achieved by programming the devices themselves (e.g. compiling and uploading a Wiring script to an Arduino UNO), or by reading the data from the device and formatting it accordingly (e.g. using a Python script on a Raspberry Pi to read USB output from a commercial Sound Level Meter). 

## Connect The Dots getting started project ##
For this project, follow the instructions for configuring the following:

1. [Arduino UNO with weather shield](GatewayConnectedDevices/Arduino%20UNO/Weather/WeatherShieldJson/Arduino-and-Weather-Shield-setup.md) 
2. [Raspberry Pi](Gateways/GatewayService/RaspberryPi-Gateway-setup.md) 

If you're following the getting started project, the next task is the [sample website deployment](../Azure/WebSite/WebsitePublish.md).

## Build your own 

To build your own end-to-end configuration you need to identify and configure the device(s) that will be producing the data to be pushed to Azure and displayed/analyzed. Devices fall generally into two categories - those that can connect directly to the Internet, and those that need to connect to the Internet through some intermediate device or gateway. Sample code and documentation can be found in the following folders:

1. [Simple devices requiring a gateway](GatewayConnectedDevices/) - Devices too small or basic to support a secure IP connection, or which need to be aggregated before sending to Azure
2. [Devices connecting directly to Azure](DirectlyConnectedDevices/) - Devices powerful enough to support a secure IP connection
3. [Gateways or other intermediary devices](Gateways/) - Devices which collect data from other devices and upload to Azure. These can be very simple (e.g. just package and send the data securely to Azure without changes), or very sophisticated (e.g. allow for device authentication, provisioning, management, and communications). 


### Build a sensor infrastructure ###
For additional scenarios, or more advanced configurations, follow the setup instructions in the folders for the devices or gateways listed above. For example, to include a Gadgeteer using the .NET Microframework code, follow [these instructions](DirectlyConnectedDevices/NETMF/ConnectTheDotsGadgeteer/Docs/NETMF%20Gadgeteer%20setup.md).
